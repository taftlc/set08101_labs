<h1>A brief introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Luke Taft. I was born and raised in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>. 
	I am a former <a href="https://www.marines.mil/">United States Marine</a> and while enlisted I was employed as an 0651

	>Post-9/11 GI bill</a> I gained the oppurtunity and developed the inclination to become employed as an IT professional 
	and now further that career with my studies at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier University</a>.
