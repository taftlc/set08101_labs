<h1>My Early It Career</h1>
<p>After Marine Corps finished CCNA R&S. Hired by <a href=https://stratascorp.com/>Stratascorp Technologies<a/> as a Network
		Operations Specialist - Mid for Marine Forces Korea (MARFORK). After a year of that project was hired into <a href=https://advantor.com/>Advantor Systems<a/>
		as an International Field Technician. Here my primary focus was less networking based. I was on hand to install Cisco switches and ensure connectivity
		but my primary task was an installer for security technologies.
